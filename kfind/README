kfind
=====

Kfind is a front end for the utility `find' inspired by the find
utility from NT.

At this time it is fully functional. All options available in kfind
are working. You can save the results, delete, change properties of
found files/directories, store them to an archive and ask kfm to open
the directory containing this file or execute default binding.

Compilation 
----------- 

KFind is now part of kdebase, so please direct any compilation or
installation questions to ../README and ../INSTALL. It may be necessary to
set the environment variables QTDIR and KDEDIR. 

BUGS
----

If you find what you believe to be a bug, then it would be helpful to send
me a message.

THANKS 
------ 

I want to thank Alexander Sanda <alex@darkstar.ping.at> for making
KTabCtl which is used in Kfind and Torben Weis
<weis@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> for his wonderful file manager kfm.


I hope you will find this program somehow useful and I would
appreciate any suggestions and comments.
